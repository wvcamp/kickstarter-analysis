An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose

Using the Kickstarter dataset visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals is to make informed decisions to maximize donations by looking for trends based on launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Those programs launch in May, June, and July had the greater percentage difference between Successes compared to Failures as presented by the greater distance between the graph lines.  Oct, Nov, and Dec had the least percentage difference between Successes and Failures as presented by the least distance between the graph lines.   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The less than 1000, and 35000 to 44999 range has the greatest amount of success.  

The ranges of 25000 to 29999 and 45000 to 49999 had the least amount of success,

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

April, May, and June were the months with the greatest number of campaigns.  September and December had the least number of campaigns.  It would be very to have more campaigns in July and less campaigns in April.
Reduce the number of campaigns in Oct., Nov., and December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Plan more campaigns in the 35000 to 44999 range and less campaigns in the 25000 to 29999 and 45000 to 49999 range

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1)	Not sure if any currency conversion to US dollars have occurred.
2)	Date needed to be converted to a YYYY/MM/DD format.
3)	Several outliers as indicated above.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The goal should be to maximize money from donations versus looking solely by success or failures.  Possible graphs are to show donations by Month Created by Parent Category and within Subcategory.  
Other graphs would be Budget by Month Created by Parent Category and within Subcategory.
Another graph is Backers Count by Month and average donation by Month or Parent Category and within Subcategory.
